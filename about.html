  <center><h1>OUR HISTORY</h1></center>
  <p>The history of the BMW Group reaches back to 1916. Today, the four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce, and BMW Motorrad make the BMW Group one of the world’s leading premium suppliers of automobiles, motorcycles, as well as mobility services. Since the beginning of its history, the company has kept its sight firmly set on the future and has consequently put sustainability and efficient resource management into the centre of its strategy. Learn more about the history and historical focus of the BMW Group.BMW can trace its roots back to Karl Rapp and Gustav Otto. In 1916, the Flugmaschinenfabrik Gustav Otto company had merged into Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke AG (BFW) at government behest. Elsewhere, in 1917, the Rapp Motorenwerke company became Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH, which was duly converted into an AG (public limited company) in 1918. BMW AG subsequently transferred its engine construction operations – including the company and brand names – to BFW in 1922. The date of BFW’s founding, 7 March 1916, has therefore gone down in history as the foundation date of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.</p>
